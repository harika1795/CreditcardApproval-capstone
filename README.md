Credit Card Approval Project


Welcome to the Credit Card Approval project repository. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict credit card approval decisions based on applicant information. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment steps, providing a comprehensive solution for credit card approval analysis.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the credit card application data for model training, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Model Training: Utilize machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model on the preprocessed data, exploring various classifiers such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score to assess its effectiveness in predicting credit card approval decisions.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model using a web-based interface or API, allowing users to input applicant information and receive real-time predictions on credit card approval likelihood.

Technologies Used:
Python: Main programming language for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building and evaluating predictive models.
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
Flask: Web framework for model deployment.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend development for the web-based interface (if applicable).
